"""
    Server
    ------
    This module represents a TCP server. It can handle multiple clients at the same time. It uses threads for handling
    the clients. It also broadcasts the messages to all clients except the sender client. It also handles the
    disconnection of the clients. If a client disconnects from the server, it removes the client from the list and
    broadcasts a message to all clients.
